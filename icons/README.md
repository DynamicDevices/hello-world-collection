# Icon Placeholder

This directory should contain:
- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixel icon
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixel icon

These icons are referenced in the PWA manifest for mobile app-like experience.

You can generate icons from your logo using tools like:
- [PWA Icon Generator](https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator)
- [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/)
- [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)

For now, the manifest will work without icons, but adding them will improve the PWA experience.
