  - Beginner (18 languages)
  - Beginner to Intermediate (26 languages)
  - Intermediate (72 languages)
  - Intermediate to Advanced (29 languages)
  - Advanced (71 languages)
  - Beginner to Advanced (11 languages)
  - Varies (15 languages)

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### 🔧 **Visualization Button**
- **Problem**: "Show Visualizations" button wasn't working
- **Cause**: Incorrect CSS selectors (`header` vs `.header`, `#statistics` vs `.stats`)
- **Solution**: Updated DOM selectors and added debugging

### 🏷️ **Tooltip Issues**
- **Problem**: Multiple duplicate lines in popularity chart tooltips
- **Cause**: Chart.js callback system calling functions multiple times
- **Solution**: Implemented `body` callback approach with proper suppression

### 📊 **Chart.js 3.x Compatibility**
- **Problem**: Horizontal bar charts not displaying (deprecated `horizontalBar` type)
- **Solution**: Updated to `type: 'bar'` with `indexAxis: 'y'`

### 🎯 **Data Accuracy**
- **Problem**: Many languages incorrectly defaulted to "Intermediate" difficulty
- **Cause**: Incomplete difficulty mapping (missing 3 out of 7 levels)
- **Solution**: Comprehensive mapping of all actual difficulty values
